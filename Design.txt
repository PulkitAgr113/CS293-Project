The following is the basic outline of how I aim to proceed with the project, to get a project worth 1500 lines:

1. Make separate functions to plot the Mandelbrot Set with different algorithms such as Escape Time (unoptimized and optimized), Continuous Coloring, and so on.

2. Compare these methods with different metrics like runtime and quality.

3. Give option to the user to zoom into the fractal with a click of the mouse at some point.

4. Use a stack to save the state of the previous few windows, to able to implement the zoom out option as well.
